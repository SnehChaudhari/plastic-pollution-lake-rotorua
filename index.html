    <!-- Introductory paragraph on plastic pollution -->
    <p>Plastic pollution is a serious problem that affects ecosystems all around the world. It's caused by the widespread use of plastic items like bottles, packaging, and other everyday products, as well as by industrial activities. This pollution threatens rivers, oceans, and land-based environments alike. One of the main issues with plastic is that it takes an incredibly long time to break down, sticking around in the environment for hundreds or even thousands of years. As it breaks down, it releases harmful chemicals that can harm wildlife, ecosystems, and even human health. In New Zealand, this problem hits close to home, especially for Lake Rotorua, a beloved natural treasure that holds both ecological and cultural significance for the country.</p>
